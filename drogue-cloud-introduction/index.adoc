== Drogue IoT

Drogue Device:: Distribution of libraries and examples for building embedded IoT applications in Rust.
Drogue Cloud:: IoT friendly APIs and common IoT services for the cloud.

== Drogue Edge?

* We do provide edge workload when necessary
* We rely on existing projects to run edge workload
* We do integrate with edge infrastructure to orchestrate workload

[%notitle,role=center]
== Focus on Drogue Cloud

Today, the focus is on Drogue Cloud.

== The mission

Connect cloud side applications, with far edge devices.

[.center.gutter]
image::drogue-iot-mission.svg[]

=== How?

By …

* … providing IoT friendly APIs for existing cloud side technologies
* … offering common, out-of-the box IoT services
* … integrating existing technologies and services

[.notes]
--
* A lot of tools already exists
* Better align the device side with the cloud side
* It is easy to re-create things, but better to re-use and extend & integrate
--

=== Why?

* Creating IoT application is easy, at least in the beginning.
* In many IoT applications things get re-invented, over and over.
* Because the value-add comes from building applications, not infrastructure.

=== Why not?

[%step]
* Just use the cloud stuff?
[%step]
** IoT developers don't like it
[%step]
** It is not suitable for devices
[%step]
* Just use the device stuff?
[%step]
** It is just the other way round

=== The Mission (refined)

Make it easy to connect cloud side applications with far edge devices.

[.blue]
== Key concepts

Let's take a closer look.

[%notitle,role=center]
=== Diagram

image::drogue-cloud-architecture.svg[role="stretch center"]

[.notes]
--
* Devices connect to "endpoints"
** Those authenticate/authorize using the device registry
** May do some pre-processing
** And publish data to Kafka
* Applications connect to "integrations"
** Authenticate with OAuth2 or personal access tokens
** And subscribe to data
** Getting notified on demand
--

[.blue.columns]
=== Directions

[.column]
* *Telemetry*: device-to-cloud, northbound, upstream
* *Commands*: cloud-to-device, southbound, downstream
* Telemetry is the dominant direction of data

[.column]
image::telemetry-vs-commands.svg[height=75%, role="center"]

[.blue]
=== Events

* Devices and cloud exchange events
* Protocols aren't too important, the payload is
* Protocols are normalized, payload is not
[%step]
** At least on this level

[.blue.columns.smaller]
=== Event normalization

[.column]
--
Messages from devices get normalized on "Cloud Events".

Mix & match: publish as MQTT, consume using WebSocket.

The payload is just forwarded "as is".

Bring it on!

[.red]
=== Creating a device

[.stretch.vcenter]
--
[source,shell]
----
drg create application example-app
----

[%step]
[source,shell]
----
drg create device --application example-app device1
----

[%step]
[source,shell]
----
drg set password device1 "SetecAstronomy"
----

--

[.notes]
--
* This is using the `drg` tool
* But it's just a REST API
* You could also use `curl` or some other HTTP client
--

[.red]
=== Pub/sub

Consume data (application):

[source,shell]
----
websocat wss://ws-integration.sandbox.drogue.cloud/example-app \
    -H="Authorization: Bearer $(drg whoami -t)"
----

[step=1]
Publish data (device):

[step=1]
[source,shell]
----
mqtt pub -h mqtt.sandbox.drogue.cloud -p 8883 -s \
    -u 'device1@example-app' -pw 'SetecAstronomy' \

== There is more

* Event pre-processing
* Gateway concept
* Change events from the device registry
* …

[.blue]
=== Change events

* When device configurations are created, changed, delete events get fired
* You can act on them, operator style

[.blue]
=== For example

* Provision a new device in another system
  ** When a new devices get created, it is also created in The Things Network
* Synchronize configuration between systems
  ** Kubernetes workload gets configured on a device
  ** Will be synchronized to ACM{empty}footnote:[Advanced Cluster Manager] for provisioning on the edge device

== Onwards

This is the core of Drogue Cloud. Providing IoT connectivity.

And with that, we can build more.

=== Firmware Updates (OTA)

*Drogue Ajour*

* Trigger firmware updates
* Protocol between cloud and device
* Out of the box implementation for Drogue Device
* Requires an orchestrator
** Eclipse hawkBit
** OCI compatible container registries
