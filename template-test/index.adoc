== Colors

It is possible to themes slides in the different Drogue colors (yellow, red, blue), yellow
being the default.

[.red]
=== Red

But this is red. link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy[Follow me].

[quote, CSS Values and Units Module Level 3, 5. Distance Units: the &lt;length&gt; type]
Looking up into the night sky is looking into infinity—distance is incomprehensible and therefore meaningless.

[.blue]
=== Blue

And this is blue. link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy[Follow me].

[quote, How-to CSS, 1024 easy steps to center text vertically]
Would it save you a lot of time if I just gave up and went mad now?

[.yellow]
=== Yellow

Or explicitly choose yellow. link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy[Follow me].

== Layouts

Keep in mind …

// we need to use role="center" here, as `.center` doesn't seem to work in combination
// with %notitle
[%notitle,role="center"]
=== Less is more

> … less is more

[.full]
=== Booyah!

[.full]
=== Booyah!

With a subtitle

[%notitle]
=== No title

And a slide without a title.

[.center]
=== Center

By default, text is aligned to the top of the slide. But you can also center it:

1. Rust
2. Rust
3. Rust

Yes, this will also center the heading.
